# Place commands for clients to run at boot in the order that you would like to
# boot them.  For example, if you would like Debian Squeeze's cups daemon to
# start at boot:
# brc squeeze /etc/init.d/cups start
#
# Note that this is being run as a full bourne shell script; if you would like
# to try to be fancy and attempt to parallelize things it should be quite possible.
